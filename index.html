                        <h4> Don't let the name fool you:</h4>
                    </span> a black hole is anything but empty space. Rather, it is a great amount
                    of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun
                    squeezed into a sphere approximately the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational
                    field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. In recent years, NASA instruments have
                    painted a new picture of these strange objects that are, to many, the most fascinating objects in
                    space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light could not escape it has been around
                    for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity,
                    which showed that when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small, dense remnant core. If the
                    core's mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, the equations showed, the force of
                    gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scientists can't directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect x-rays, light, or other
                    forms of electromagnetic radiation. We can, however, infer the presence of black holes and study
                    them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby. If a black hole passes through a cloud of
                    interstellar matter, for example, it will draw matter inward in a process known as accretion. A
                    similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole. In this case, the black
                    hole can tear the star apart as it pulls it toward itself. As the attracted matter accelerates and
                    heats up, it emits x-rays that radiate into space. Recent discoveries offer some tantalizing
                    evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on the neighborhoods around them - emitting
                    powerful gamma ray bursts, devouring nearby stars, and spurring the growth of new stars in some
                    areas while stalling it in others.
                </p>
                <h4>One Star's End is a Black Hole's Beginning</h4>
                <p>
                    Most black holes form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion. (Smaller
                    stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) If the total mass of
                    the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), it can be proven theoretically
                    that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star
                    collapses, a strange thing occurs. As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the
                    "event horizon," time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. When the
                    surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a
                    frozen collapsing object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even bigger black holes can result from stellar collisions. Soon after its launch in December 2004,
                    NASA's Swift telescope observed the powerful, fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts.
                    Chandra and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope later collected data from the event's "afterglow," and
                    together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a
                    black hole and a neutron star collide, producing another black hole.
